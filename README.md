Real Estate Price Prediction is the process of estimating or forecasting the future prices of real estate properties, such as houses, apartments, or commercial buildings. The goal is to provide accurate property rates to buyers, sellers, investors, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions about real estate transactions.

  Gather relevant data from various sources, including real estate databases, government records, online listings, and other public or private sources.
Clean and prepare the collected data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
Create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information that can influence real estate prices.
Explore and visualize the data to gain insights into its distribution, correlations, and patterns.
Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models for the task.
Train the selected model on the training data, optimizing its parameters to make accurate predictions.
